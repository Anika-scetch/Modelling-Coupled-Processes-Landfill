### Modelling-Coupled-Processes-Landfill

### Files
The following files have been uploaded:
- Datasets (2 csv's)
- Lotka Volterra Example script
- A simplified version of the L-V script with only the ODE (not Euler/Runge-Kutta)
- Anika's current working attempt at a solution ('Wastewater.py')

### Notes about the python script:
It's in progress, but needs a lot of work. I got some tips from Timo (Emma Little was there too) that I still have to work into the current version before checking if it will work.

### To-Do:
- [ ] Create an overleaf doc where we discuss how we drew out conclusions
- [ ] Get a working script hahaha
